# Advisor implementation plan — execution track

**Sources:** `ADVISOR_AGENT_UPDATE_2026-06-02.md` (advisor review), `IMPLEMENT_PLAN.md` (locked semantics).  
**Signed off:** 2026-06-02 — **Track A (A0–A6)** semantics. **A7 deferred** (unified public-as-Rally model).

**Build sign-off:** 2026-06-02 — Phases **0, 2, 4** engineering **complete** (QA pending). Migration **032** applied to linked Supabase (`casljueycxsqexpkdiuq`) via `supabase db query -f … --linked`.

Use this doc to **track build vs QA**. Decision detail lives in `IMPLEMENT_PLAN.md`. Collective QA → `QA_BETA_CREW_CHECKLIST.md`, `QA_BUILD_HANDOFF.md`.

> **Signed off ≠ every sub-task shipped.** Track A **locks product rules** (A2 guests, A6 legacy). **Engineering** may defer sub-tasks (see A2 Phase 3, A6-3/4) without reopening semantics.
