# Module contract — Coach / parent navigation & entrances

**Contract id:** `module-coach-parent-navigation`  
**Status:** **Green** — validation 2026-06-22: cross-contract sim proof (B2/B3/B4) on flags-on build  
**Product review:** [2026-06-21-onboarding-synthesis.md](../product-review/consolidated/2026-06-21-onboarding-synthesis.md) · tier 3: [2026-06-22-onboarding-expert-synthesis.md](../product-review/consolidated/2026-06-22-onboarding-expert-synthesis.md)  
**UI ideas:** [parent-student-coach-ui-ideas.md](../coach-parent-student/parent-student-coach-ui-ideas.md)  
**Safety:** [parent-student-coach-safety-design.md](../coach-parent-student/parent-student-coach-safety-design.md)  
**Related code:** `HomeScreen.tsx`, `ProfileScreen`, `DynamicHomeScreen.tsx`, `RegularsCrewScreen.tsx`, `coachParentService.ts`, Inbox

## Purpose

Role-based coach/parent surfaces **inside existing tabs** — no 5th tab, no bolt-on module app.

North-star:

```text
Profile = setup (Family section + Coach Tools section)
Today / Rally hub = ongoing classes & schedules
Inbox = announcements & enrollment
Play = discover (Classes segment) + light next-action cards only
```

**Market sizing:** Niche but profitable — sections on Profile are **real sections with cards**, not a new tab. Play stays discovery-first.

## Tab map (app tabs today)

| Tab | Code / screen | Coach/parent use |
|-----|---------------|------------------|
| **Today** | `DynamicHomeScreen` | My Classes summary; Coach today card (optional) |
| **Play** | `HomeScreen` | Games \| Players \| **Classes** (sport-filtered) |
| **Inbox** | Inbox filters | Class announcements, cancel/defer, enroll requests |
| **Profile** | `ProfileScreen` | **Family** section · **Coach Tools** section (role-gated) |

`Rallys` = Rally groups → `RegularsCrew` hub (from Today carousel / Inbox). Class Rally reuses hub + detail pattern.

## Profile — Family section (v1.2)

**Agreed:** Family lives as a **Profile section** (not a separate app area).

| State | Must show |
|-------|-----------|
| **Section header** | **Family** — visible when `PARENT_FAMILY_UI` **and** adult parent intent, **including zero children** (R1 locked) |
| **Family Profiles row/card** | Subtitle: *Manage child/student profiles for classes* |
| **List push** | Per-child rows: nickname · active class summary |
| **Add Child Profile** | Lime CTA on list screen |
| **Parent Settings / Consent** | Links to [flow-parent-guardian-consent.md](./flow-parent-guardian-consent.md) |
| **Privacy** | *Private — only you and enrolled coaches* |
| **Hidden for non-parents** | No Family section for R0 players, teens, or flag-off builds |
| **Empty state (zero children)** | Section visible with empty copy + Add Child path — not hidden until first child |

Parent + coach users see **both** Family and Coach Tools sections when each role gate passes.

**Reference dual-role demo:** `marcus@rally-mvrhoops.demo` (Marcus) is the seeded dual-role reference — Family + Coach Tools both visible. Validator must also test **fresh accounts** without Marcus user-id hardcode in `shouldShowFamilySection` / `userIsCoach` (B6).

## Profile — Coach Tools section (v1.1)

| State | Must show |
|-------|-----------|
| **Section header** | **Coach Tools** — only if adult + `coach` role / Founding Coach |
| **Teen accounts** | **Never** — force-hide when `age_category = teen_13_17` regardless of `is_coach` (R3 locked) — [flow-teen-account-onboarding.md](./flow-teen-account-onboarding.md) |
| **Become a coach** | **Not in v1** — no self-serve apply; admin/seed sets `is_coach` — [flow-coach-onboarding-org.md](./flow-coach-onboarding-org.md) |
| **Coach Profile** | Sport, area, edit |
| **Payment link / note** | External link text only v1 |
| **Class Templates** | Optional v1.1 — or defer to Create flow |
| **Create Class** | Entry to class Rally create (coach create flow) |
| **Absent for non-coaches** | Entire section hidden — no upsell hero |

## Today / Rally hub — ongoing classes

| State | Surface | Must show |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| **Parent My Classes** | Today block | Per-child upcoming classes — **only** adult parent with children or active enrollments |
| **Coach Classes I teach** | Today block or hub Play tab | Today's class, enrolled/confirmed counts — adult coach only; **never** for teens |
| **Class detail** | Rally-style screen | Tabs: Overview · Schedule · Roster · Chat |
| **Empty parent (zero children)** | Profile Family CTA | *Manage classes for your child* → Profile Family — **not** MY CLASSES card with parent copy on Today |
| **Empty coach** | Coach Tools CTA | *Create your first class* |
| **R0 / teen / coach zero-child** | Today | **No** MY CLASSES block — see B4 rule below |

**MY CLASSES visibility rule (B4):** Show when adult + (`studentCount > 0` OR explicit parent intent OR active enrollments). Hide for R0 players, teens (`teen_13_17`), and coaches with zero children. Cross-ref [flow-coach-onboarding-org.md](./flow-coach-onboarding-org.md).

**Dual-role scroll density (P3):** Parent + coach users may see Family section, Coach Tools, and both Today cards — acceptable for v1; note density in Validator notes if Today feels crowded.

Contracts: [flow-coach-minor-class-roster.md](./flow-coach-minor-class-roster.md) · [flow-student-class-enrollment.md](./flow-student-class-enrollment.md)

## Play — Classes segment (v1.1)

Third pill: **Games | Players | Classes**. **Sport filter required** (same as Games).

| State | Must show |
|-------|-----------|
| **Classes list** | `GameCardShell` + `classDiscover` preset |
| **Sport sync** | Basketball filter → basketball classes only |
| **Empty** | *No {sport} classes nearby* |
| **Light cards** | Next class (parent) / Coach today — **only if user has class context** |
| **No admin on Play** | No roster edit, no Family setup on Play main feed |

Preset: `classDiscover` in `gameCardLayouts.ts`.

## Inbox — announcements (v1.3+)

| State | Must show |
|-------|-----------|
| **Parent** | Coach/class announcement threads in Inbox → **Classes** filter |
| **Coach** | Parent replies, can't-make-it, enrollment |
| **No child DM** | Coach → parent/guardian only — [module-student-visibility.md](./module-student-visibility.md) |
| **Row detail** | Tap announcement → readable full message + sent time — [flow-inbox.md](./flow-inbox.md) |

### Coach broadcast (tier 4 product review)

**Human gate H1 (locked R1=A):** MVP = **session defer/cancel + Notify parents** toggle only (`ClassOperationsSheet`). Freeform class-note composer is **backlog** (persona `coach-announcement-sender` P0 deferred).

| State | Must show (MVP) |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Manage session** | Defer / Cancel with **Notify parents** switch (default on) |
| **Parent receive** | Notification row in Inbox → Classes (`class_parent_notifications`) |
| **Class detail Chat tab** | Placeholder until composer ships — must not imply working DM |

| State | Backlog (post-H1 B) |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Compose note** | Coach Tools or Class detail → freeform message → parent Inbox Classes |
| **Chat tab** | Read-only history + compose for coach |

**Product review:** [2026-06-24-cross-surface-tier4-synthesis.md](../product-review/consolidated/2026-06-24-cross-surface-tier4-synthesis.md)

## Create flow — role-based options

| Role | Create sheet options |
|------|---------------------|
| Normal | Casual Game · Rally Group |
| Coach (adult only) | + **Class / Clinic** |
| Teen (`teen_13_17`) | Casual Game · Rally Group only — **no** Class/Clinic even if `is_coach` set in DB |
| Venue admin (later) | + Venue Open Play |

Only show extra options when role permits. Teen age gate on Create flow: see [flow-teen-account-onboarding.md](./flow-teen-account-onboarding.md) H2 probe.

## Class session card variant

Reuse `CrewGameSessionCard` / session preset with class labels:

| Viewer | Shows |
|--------|-------|
| Parent | Child name · Confirmed/Not responded · fee note · Confirm / Can't make it |
| Coach | Enrolled · confirmed counts · Roster / Message / Nudge / Cancel |

Preset: extend `rallySession` or add `classSession` when implementing — update `module-game-card.md`.

## Deep links

| Link | Lands on |
|------|----------|
| Parent class invite | Child profile picker → enroll — [flow-student-class-enrollment.md](./flow-student-class-enrollment.md) |
| Adult class share | Class detail (18+ discover) |

## Feature flags

| Flag | Default | Enables |
|------|---------|---------|
| `COACH_CLASSES_DISCOVER` | `false` | Play → Classes segment |
| `PARENT_FAMILY_UI` | `false` | Profile → Family section |
| `COACH_DASHBOARD` | `false` | Profile → Coach Tools section |
| `CLASS_INBOX_ANNOUNCE` | `false` | Inbox announcement threads |

GTM 1: **all off** — store build must pass **flag-off** checklist below.

## Validation modes

| Mode | Flags | When |
|------|-------|------|
| **Production default** | All CPS flags `false` | App Store / Play v1.0 adult beta |

| H4 | 5th tab? | **No** |

## Out of scope (v1)

- 5th bottom tab
